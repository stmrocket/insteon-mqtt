    """Base class for all Insteon devices.

    This class implements the required API for all devices and handles
    functions that are the same for all devices.

    The run_command() method is used for arbitrary remote commanding
    (via MQTT for example).  The input is a dict (or keyword args)
    containing a 'cmd' key with the value as the command name and any
    additional arguments needed for the command as other key/value
    pairs. Valid commands for all devices are:

       getdb:    No arguments.  Download the PLM modem all link database
                 and save it to file.
       refresh:  No arguments.  Ping the device and see if the database is
                 current.  Reloads the modem database if needed.
